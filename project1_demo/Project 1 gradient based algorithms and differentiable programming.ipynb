    "Consider a simple formulation of rocket landing where the rocket state $x(t)$ is represented by its distance to the ground $d(t)$ and its velocity $v(t)$, i.e., $x(t) = [d_x(t), v_x(t), d_y(t), v_y(t), \\theta(t)]^T$, where $t$ specifies time. The control input of the rocket is its acceleration $a(t)$ and angular velocity $\\omega(t)$. The discrete-time dynamics follows \n",
